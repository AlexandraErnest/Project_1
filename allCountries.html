                    <p>
                        The United States is one of the biggest and most well-known countries on earth! 
                        From McDonalds to Hollywood movies, American culture has spread far and wide. 
                        But the USA is so much more than what you can see in a movie.

                    <p>
                        Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snow capped mountains, vast monuments, 
                        and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favored travel destination. 
                        The country is geographically and culturally diverse. Its heartland is the Meseta, 
                        a broad central plateau half a mile above sea level.

                    <p>
                        India has a unique culture and is one of the oldest and greatest civilizations of 
                        the world. India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence. 
                        India covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights
                        to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India 
                        stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give 
                        the country a distinct geographical entity.

                    <p>
                        Japan is a fascinating country of economic and business prowess, rich culture, 
                        technical wizardry, spatial conundrums and contradictions. Japan held onto the title of
                         the world’s second largest economy for more than 40 years from 1968 to 2010. 
                         Tokyo, Japan’s capital city, is the world’s largest metropolitan area, with a 
                         population of 32.5 million people.

                    <h2>Ethiopia</h2>
                    <p>
                        The country lies completely within the tropical latitudes and is relatively compact, 
                        with similar north-south and east-west dimensions. The capital is Addis Ababa (“New Flower”), 
                        located almost at the center of the country. Ethiopia is the largest and most populated 
                        country in the Horn of Africa. With the 1993 secession of Eritrea, its former province along 
                        the Red Sea, Ethiopia became landlocked.
